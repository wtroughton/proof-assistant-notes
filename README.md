# About
My foray into writing proofs with proof assistants. Following Benjamin Pierce's [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) course in Coq.

My notes include a mix of following the programming examples, writing my own chapter briefs, and a tangle of personal notes as I work through the book.
